   <h1>Virtualization</h1>
<body>
    <p>In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>

 <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>   
 <h4>1.Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level </h4>
   <p>
   	 Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is   an interface between software and hardware.
     Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.
    </p>
  <h4>2.Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</h4>
   <p>
   	In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.
     <ul type="creating">
   	   <li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.
   	   </li>
   	   <li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware
   	   </li>

     </ul>
